# Weather-Index 
## Description
Have you ever wondered what the weather is like in your favorite city? Perhaps you needed to know what items to pack for your next getaway. The Weather Dashboard is a handy tool for the traveler, student, or busy individual who wants to get a quick look at the current weather and an extended five day weather forecast for any city searched in the input field. In this project I learned to fetch API calls to retrieve data from the OpenWeather API. The project required setting the appropriate parameters to achieve the desired weather results. I revisted the utilization of local storage, in order to create a past searched history list of the city and the corresponding results, as well as the remove item method of local storage to create a functional clear history button. 

## Installation
Simply follow the Url link provided below and open in the browser(chrome preferred). Type in the city of your choice. The API call is set to capture the results of the 1st city in the fetch. Refresh the page to see a list of previous searched cities (orange buttons on the right of page). The buttons with the city names can be clicked to return to the past results. Click on the clear history button to delete these results. 

## Features
* Clear History button
